# Progetto di Reti Logiche

This repository contains the project made for the "Reti Logiche" course at Politecnico di Milano for the academic year 2022/2023.

This project was carried out by my colleague, [Riccardo Manfredonia](https://github.com/manfroso), and myself.

The aim of the project was to create a small memory controller in VHDL to access some data and output it through four ports. The software used for this project was [Xilinx Vivado](https://www.xilinx.com/products/design-tools/vivado.html).

You can read more about it in the [report](REPORT.md) (written in Italian).
